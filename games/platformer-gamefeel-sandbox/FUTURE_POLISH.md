# âœ¨ Potential Future Polish Features

- **Jump Cut Downward Nudge:**
  Apply a small, one-time downward velocity when the jump button is released, for extra snappy short hops.

- **Minimum Jump Height:**
  Ensure the player always reaches a minimum height, even if the jump button is tapped very quickly.

- **Camera Triggers / Zones:**
  Use invisible triggers or zones to control the camera in specific areas (e.g., boss rooms, cutscenes, or to lock the camera for a challenge section).
